# Food-collection-and-distribution

# Abstract
There are numerous events happening daily all over the world, and while food is a necessary element of these events, it is observed that more than 60% of them don't consume the projected amount of food, and if the leftovers don't make it to the appropriate welfare groups, they are wasted.

This community service project aims to address food scarcity in the local community through the collection and distribution of food at such events. The project involves partnering with local businesses and organizations to collect surplus food that would otherwise go to waste. 

Volunteers will then sort and package the food before distributing it to those in need through partnerships with local food banks, shelters, and community centers.
